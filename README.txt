Usage
----------------
About the codes of DOTSOCP:

- Codes in socp/dot1d are for 1-dimensional DOT
- Codes in socp/dot2d are for 2-dimensional DOT            
- Codes in socp/wdot2d are for 2-dimensional Weighted DOT

Users can run some simple demos:

- /demo_dot1d.m is for 1-dimensional DOT
- /demo_dot2d.m is for 2-dimensional DOT
- /demo_wdot2d.m is for 2-dimensional Weighted-DOT
